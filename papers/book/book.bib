@article{sands_avoidance,
	abstract = {
	Using publicly-available traffic camera feeds in combination with a real-world field experiment, we examine how pedestrians of different races behave in the presence of racial out-group members, and how these interactions vary across different types of neighborhoods. By measuring the distance that pedestrians maintain between other pedestrians of various racial groups, we generate a novel measure of intergroup behavior. In doing so we give scholars a new way to unobtrusively study implicit bias during actual social interactions, thus eliminating concerns about researcher demand effects. We find that pedestrians give a wider berth to African American confederates, as compared to white non-Hispanic confederates, and that this tendency is more pronounced in a homogeneously white neighborhood than in a racially heterogeneous neighborhood.

	abstract = {A large body of work highlights disparities in survival rates across Black and White newborns during childbirth. We posit that these differences may be ameliorated by racial concordance between the physician and newborn patient. Findings suggest that when Black newborns are cared for by Black physicians, the mortality penalty they suffer, as compared with White infants, is halved. Strikingly, these effects appear to manifest more strongly in more complicated cases, and when hospitals deliver more Black newborns. No such concordance effect is found among birthing mothers.Recent work has emphasized the benefits of patient{\textendash}physician concordance on clinical care outcomes for underrepresented minorities, arguing it can ameliorate outgroup biases, boost communication, and increase trust. We explore concordance in a setting where racial disparities are particularly severe: childbirth. In the United States, Black newborns die at three times the rate of White newborns. Results examining 1.8 million hospital births in the state of Florida between 1992 and 2015 suggest that newborn{\textendash}physician racial concordance is associated with a significant improvement in mortality for Black infants. Results further suggest that these benefits manifest during more challenging births and in hospitals that deliver more Black babies. We find no significant improvement in maternal mortality when birthing mothers share race with their physician.Data and materials are available by limited use agreement from the Florida AHCA.},

	abstract = {Natural experiments help to overcome some of the obstacles researchers face when making causal inferences in the social sciences. However, even when natural interventions are randomly assigned, some of the treatment--control comparisons made available by natural experiments may not be valid. We offer a framework for clarifying the issues involved, which are subtle and often overlooked. We illustrate our framework by examining four different natural experiments used in the literature. In each case, random assignment of the intervention is not sufficient to provide an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Additional assumptions are required that are problematic. For some examples, we propose alternative research designs that avoid these conceptual difficulties.},
