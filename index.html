<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></h3>


  <p>Welcome! My name is Chagai Weiss. I am a Political Science PhD candidate at the <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a></b>, and a Middle East Initiative predoctoral fellow at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School</a></b>.
    <p>
  

 My core interest is in examining how institutions and the people within them shape intergroup relations in divided societies. I am also working on several projects examining the effects of scalable interventions for prejudice reduction, the electoral effects of conflict, the institutional origins of partisan polarization, and experimental methods. My research has been published or is forthcoming in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cambridge.org/">Cambridge University Press</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pnas.org/">the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ajps.org/">the American Journal of Political Science</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ajps.org/">Comparative Political Studies</a></b>, and other jourals.
  <p>
  
  

I co-coordinate <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=" https://igr.netlify.app/">the Intergroup Relations Workshop</a></b> — a virtual workshop which meets periodically to provide feedback on political science and social psychology research relating to intergroup relations. </p>  


In Fall 2020 I will join the <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/our-work/research-initiatives/conflict-and-polarization">Conflict and Polarization Lab</a></b> at <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a></b> as a postdoctoral fellow. </p>

 <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('abstractionbook');">[Overview]</a></i>
<div id="abstractionbook" style="display:none;"><br>In our book we explore the consequences of abstraction and detail in experimental design and innovate both theoretically and empirically. We offer an overarching
conceptual framework outlining three different dimensions of abstraction implicated
in experimental design: situational hypotheticality, actor identity, and contextual detail. We then test our theoretical framework by fielding eight survey experiments manipulating levels of abstraction
along our three theorized dimensions. Doing so, we explore how experimental
results change when varying different levels of abstraction in experimental stimuli.

<b>Prejudice Reduction at Scale: How Institutional Inclusion Reduce Social Exclusion.</b> In progress.<br>


 
 <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('cmwbook');">[Overview]</a></i>
<div id="cmwbook" style="display:none;"><br>In my dissertation and ongoing book project, I theorize and test how and when diversity in public institutions can reduce majority group members' prejudice towards minorities. I argue that employing minorities in public institutions can affect intergroup relations and shape majority group perceptions of minorities through two distinct mechanisms relating to: 
<ul>
    <li><b>Positive intergroup contact between minority civil servants and citizens</b>, which facilitates a sense of commonality.</li>
    <li><b>Exposure to Information about the role of minorities in society</b>, which corrects misperceptions and stereotypes.</li>
</ul>
To test my theory I focus on healthcare institutions, a central arena of public goods provision where diversity is prescribed as a policy tool to promote more equitable societal outcomes. In my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2022634118">job market paper</a></b>, recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, I provide evidence for the first mechanism of my theory relating to intergroup contact. I further test the second mechanism of my theory in a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="papers/inprogress/mei_diveristy.pdf">Middle East Initiative working paper</a></b> reporting results from a series of survey experiments implemented in Israel and the U.S. during the height of the first COVID-19 wave of 2020.  <p>

I am currently combining the empirical tests of my theory, along with several theoretical and descriptive chapters, into a book monograph. The primary contribution of my monograph is in laying out an institutional approach for prejudice reduction, demonstrating how public institutions and the people within them can shape intergroup relations in divided societies. My book will include eight substantive chapters: 

<ul>
    <li><b>Introduction</b>.</li>
    <li><b>A theory of prejudice reduction through diversity in public institutions</b> — In which I lay out the different mechanisms through which diversity in public institutions can reduce majority group prejudice towards minorities in divided societies.</li>
    <li><b>The Stability of Jewish Prejudice Towards Palestinians</b> — A descriptive analyses of my dependent variable — Jewish Israeli prejudice towards Palestinians, in which I contextualize the nature of prejudice in Israel since 1948, and provide quantitative evidence for the stability of Jewish Israeli exclusionary attitudes since the early 21st century.</li>
    <li><b>How and Why do Institutions Diversify?</b> A descriptive account of my independent variable in which I examine government documents and policy reports to explore the process of diversification in Israeli public institutions as well as the stated motivations of elected officials, bureaucrats, and civil society organization, in promoting diversity in Israeli public institutions.</li>
    <li><b>How Intergroup Contact with Out-Group Doctors Reduces Prejudice</b> — A test of the first mechanism of my theory, relating to intergroup contact.</li>
    <li><b>How Information about Diversity in Public Institutions Reduces Prejudice </b> — A test of the second mechanism of my theory, relating to information.</li>
    <li><b>Generalizability and Scope Conditions </b> — A test of geographical and institutional scope conditions of my theory based on a series of survey experiments in Israel and the U.S.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusion </b> — In which I reflect on the ability of public institutions to promote scalable and sustainable prejudice reduction.</li>
</ul>

 <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('nimby');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="nimby" style="display:none;"><br>Affordable housing is a key challenge of the 21st century. One particularly important driver of growing housing prices is residents' opposition to construction, a phenomenon known as NIMBYism ("Not In My Backyard"). Faced with growing prices and resident NIMBYism, city governments have increasingly implemented rent control policies. Does rent control|by making tenants more likely to stay in their apartments spark NIMBYism and thus exacerbate the housing crisis? We study the case of Berlin, which recently passed a sweeping rent control law. Leveraging two discontinuities in the policy, we show that rent control made tenants less NIMBY. Specifically, tenants in rent controlled apartments became more likely to approve of local-level
construction and immigration, compared to tenants in non-rent-controlled apartments. We argue that the decline in NIMBYism is likely due to an economic channel. Tenants in urban centers associate construction and immigration with displacement pressures and gentrification. Rent control alleviates these concerns by providing financial and residential security.
