<p>Welcome! My name is Chagai Weiss. I am a postdoctoral fellow at <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/our-work/research-initiatives/conflict-and-polarization">the Conflict and Polarization Lab</a></b> at <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a></b>. I defended my dissertation at <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wisc.edu/">the Political Science Department</a></b> at <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">the University of Wisconsin-Madison</a></b> in summer 2022, after spending two years as a Middle East Initiative predoctoral fellow at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/">the Harvard Kennedy School</a></b>.\
<p>\
  \
My research focuses on the political effects and institutional remedies of conflict and polarization, centering around three main themes: institutions and intergroup relations, political behavior in the shadow of conflict, and experimental methodology. In my ongoing book project, titled <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="papers/book/weiss_book_overview.pdf">"Prejudice Reduction at Scale: How Institutional Inclusion Reduces Social Exclusion"</a></b> (under advance contract with  <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://press.princeton.edu/series/princeton-studies-in-political-behavior">Princeton University Press, Studies in Political Behavior Series</a></b>), I explain why reducing prejudice in conflict-ridden societies is challenging and how minority institutional inclusion can reduce social exclusion. My work is regionally focused on Israel-Palestine, but is comparative in nature, and I am continuously working on various studies based on data from across the Middle East, the United States, and Europe. \

My research has been published in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cambridge.org/">Cambridge University Press</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pnas.org/">the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review">the American Political Science Review</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ajps.org/">the American Journal of Political Science</a></b>, <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ajps.org/">Comparative Political Studies</a></b>, and other journals.\

\
I co-coordinate <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=" https://igr.netlify.app/">the Intergroup Relations Workshop</a></b> \'97 a virtual workshop which meets periodically to provide feedback on political science and social psychology research relating to intergroup relations.
